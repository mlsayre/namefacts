"NameFacts" is my first attempt at an independent app using the Ruby on Rails framework. Thanks to the Michael Hartl
tutorial and Google for helping me complete it! Simply enter your name and it gives you random facts about it, like
its number of letters, its value in Scrabble, and what it could be in Klingon.
